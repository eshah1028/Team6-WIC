    <h2>Why is supporting small business restaurants important?</h2>
    <p>Supporting small business restaurants boosts the local economy, creates jobs, 
    and keeps money within the community. These restaurants offer unique, high-quality 
    food with a personal touch while fostering cultural diversity. They provide better 
    customer service, strengthen community bonds, and often prioritize sustainability 
    by sourcing locally. Choosing small restaurants means supporting passionate entrepreneurs
    and preserving vibrant, one-of-a-kind dining experiences.
